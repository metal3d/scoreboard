## Installation

You could use FlatHub https://flathub.org/fr/apps/org.metal3d.scoreboard.

Or downloade from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/metal3d/scoreboard/releases) for you targeted system.

## Why this app?

Because I play Scrabble with my wife and I hate to write scores on a paper. Some mobile applications exist, but I wanted the application to be **simple**.

And also, because I love [Fyne.io](https://fyne.io) library, I wanted to present how it is possible to create such application with it.
